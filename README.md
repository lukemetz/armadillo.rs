Rustpy
=====

A simple library to allow for easy use of python from rust.

This library is meant to be middle ware for users wanting to use
python libraries from rust. It allows users to quickly use existing
tools and get working on interesting things fast!

See [pysmtplib.rs](https://github.com/lukemetz/pysmtplib.rs) for an
example of how to bind enough smtplib to send emails.


For more documentation, run `rustdoc src/rustpy.rs` and look at
doc/rustpy/index.html. Pull requests are welcome!

```rust
extern crate rustpy;
use rustpy::{PyType, PyState};

fn main() {
  let py = PyState::new();
  let module = py.get_module("math").unwrap();
  let func = module.get_func("sqrt").unwrap();
  let args = (144f32, ).to_py_object(&py).unwrap();
  let untyped_res = func.call(&args).unwrap();
  let result = py.from_py_object::<f32>(untyped_res).unwrap();
  assert_eq!(result, 12f32);
}
```
Important note: Only create one instance of PyState at a time.
On construction, it grabs a global lock to prevent more than one thread from
interacting with the interpreter thus making it very easy to deadlock.
